"""
Turning a DataCite or CrossRef answer into a Bioschemas block.

One function per registry, because the two describe a work differently: DataCite
answers for the Zenodo depositions every simulation points at, CrossRef for the
journal articles most experiments point at. Both are mapped onto the same set of
properties here, so the rest of the pipeline never sees which registry replied.

``resolve_doi`` is the one entry point that touches the network, and it caches
each answer on disk so a re-run over the databank asks once per DOI.
