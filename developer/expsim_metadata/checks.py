"""
Validating what a run wrote.

``check`` re-reads one record and reports what is missing, malformed or
inconsistent with the record's own fields; ``duplicate_names`` is the one test
that cannot be made record by record, since two records only clash when both are
looked at. Both are what ``--check`` reports, and neither modifies anything.
