"""
Reading and rewriting a ``README.yaml``.

The file is never re-serialised: the generated block is appended and only that
block is rewritten, so the hand-written comments most experiment records carry
survive a run. What is normalised beyond the block are the date fields, which
YAML would otherwise parse into date objects the schemas reject.

``process`` is one record end to end -- read, resolve the DOI, enrich, write --
and is what the command line maps over the databank.
