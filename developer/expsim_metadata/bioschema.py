"""
Building the Bioschemas ``Dataset`` block of one record.

Everything the block states about a record that is not simply copied from a
registry is decided here: which ontology terms describe the analysis, which
keywords the composition contributes, what the analysis outputs beside the
README amount to as a distribution, and which work the record is part of.

``enrich`` is the whole of it in order, and is what ``expsim_metadata.records`` calls
once the registry answer has been fetched.
