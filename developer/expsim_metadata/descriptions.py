"""
Composing the ``name`` and ``description`` of a simulation or experiment record.

Both are written from the record's own fields rather than fetched, because a
registry title names the paper or the Zenodo deposition and hundreds of records
share one of those. ``autocomplete_expsim_metadata`` calls in here for the two
composed properties and for nothing else.

A description is three sentences -- what the system is, how it was measured,
where it came from -- and there is one function per kind of analysis:

- :func:`simulation_description` -- molecular dynamics trajectories
- :func:`nmr_description`        -- order parameters measured by NMR
- :func:`xray_description`       -- form factors measured by scattering

The three share the sentences that do not depend on the technique, so the parts
that differ -- the instrument, the sample, whether a value was digitised out of
a paper -- are the only thing each function spells out. :func:`compose_description`
picks between them, which is the only entry point the caller needs.

Every value read out of the record comes from ``expsim_metadata.fields``; this module
only arranges those values into sentences.
