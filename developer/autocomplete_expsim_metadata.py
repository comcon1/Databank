"""
Script for simulation and experiment Bioschemas autocomplete.

This script fills a ``bioschema_properties`` block in a simulation or experiment
``README.yaml`` so the record can be published as a `Bioschemas Dataset
<https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Dataset/1.0-RELEASE>`_. It is the dataset-level
counterpart of ``autocomplete_mol_metadata.py``, which does the same job for
molecules.

``name`` and ``description`` are composed from the record's own fields --
composition, temperature, hydration, ions, method -- and never taken from the
registry. A registry title names the paper or the Zenodo deposition, not the one
measurement or trajectory the record holds, so it describes the wrong thing and
does not tell sibling records apart: before this, 104 experiments shared 37
titles and 896 simulations shared 479. The fetched title is kept where it is
true, as ``isPartOf.name`` on the parent work, and fetched abstracts are dropped.

Every composed title ends in a bracketed tag that keeps near-identical records
apart -- the databank ``ID`` for a simulation, the first author and year for an
experiment. ``--check`` reports any two records that still share a title, and is
meant to be pointed at the whole databank, since only a full run can see a clash.

An experiment can carry two DOIs that mean different things, and the ``fields``
module decides once which is used for what: the ``ARTICLE_DOI`` is looked up,
because CrossRef holds the authors and the journal, and it becomes ``isPartOf``;
the ``DATA_DOI`` is what gets cited and what ``sameAs`` points at, because the
rule in ``docs/src/schemas/experiment_metadata.md`` is to cite the data. With
only one of them given, that one fills every role.

The remaining values are resolved from the record's DOI:

- DataCite -- Zenodo depositions, i.e. every simulation
- CrossRef -- journal articles, i.e. most experiments
- SPDX     -- the licence list, used as the licence controlled vocabulary

giving creators, dates, licence, publisher, citations and the parent work's
title. These are enriched from data already in the repository (composition,
force field, NMR/X-ray method, the analysis outputs present beside the README)
with terms from EDAM, CHMO and UO.

Properties that depend on where the databank is deployed -- ``identifier``,
``url``, ``@id``, ``@type``, ``@context``, ``dct:conformsTo`` and
``includedInDataCatalog`` -- are deliberately *not* written here; the web
frontend supplies them.

The script also normalises the surrounding record: dates are rewritten as quoted
ISO strings, and ``PUBLICATION`` is retired in favour of ``citation`` once its
content is safely represented there.

The work itself is not in this file. It lives in the ``expsim_metadata``
package beside it, one module per layer -- ``constants`` (with the ontology
terms and the databank's own names in ``constants.yaml``), ``helpers``,
``licenses``, ``registries``, ``fields``, ``descriptions``, ``bioschema``,
``records`` and ``checks``. This file is the command line over them.

.. note::
   This file is meant to be used by automated workflows.

   Unlike ``autocomplete_mol_metadata.py`` the file is **not** re-serialised. The
   generated block is appended, and only that block is rewritten in place, so
   hand-written comments elsewhere in the README survive -- most experiment
   files carry them. Runs are idempotent: a record whose content has not changed
   keeps its original ``_source.retrieved`` date.

   Upstream services answer with transient ``5xx`` errors from time to time, so
   requests are retried with exponential backoff that honours any
   ``Retry-After`` header. The retry budget can be overridden with the
   ``AUTOCOMPLETE_MAX_RETRIES`` environment variable (``0`` disables retries).
